# Data-Science-Portfolio-Projects
This reporsitory will be my new project to establish a Data science portfolio and showcase my skills.
I will follow the following procedure:
1. Data Exploration in SQL
2. Data cleaning and EDA in Python
3. Modeling in Python
4. Grab the results from the Model and build a Data Viz on Tableau

For this project, I stumbled upon this dataset from Data.gov(https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?q=&sort=views_recent+desc)
of Crime data from 2020 to Present.
Follow me for my journey!
