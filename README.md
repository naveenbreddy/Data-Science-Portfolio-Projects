# Data-Science-Portfolio-Projects
Latest: Customer Churn prediction: using a generic dataset, tried on different concepts of EDA, feature engineering, visualization, preprocessing, modeling with different models like xgboost, rfs.

Previous: Basic Machine learning modeling - SPACESHIP TITANIC dataset - predicting transportation status using Randomf Forest and XGBoost classifier (in End-End ML modeling folder)
**Kaggle rank of #407 on the first attemp**


This reporsitory will be my new project to establish a Data science portfolio and showcase my skills.
I will follow the following procedure:
1. Data Exploration in SQL
2. Data cleaning and EDA in Python
3. Modeling in Python
4. Grab the results from the Model and build a Data Viz on Tableau

Follow me for my journey!
